A personal portfolio created with React!

As I am currently teaching myself the ins-and-outs of React as best as I can, I figured working on a portfolio that can be ever-changing as I continue to grow as
a developer would be the best start!

As of now, the next changes will be dedicated to possible transitions for the "about me" section as well as linking projects and establishing a way to contact me, 
whether you do it through a contact form or various social media!
