A personal portfolio created with React!

As I am currently teaching myself the ins-and-outs of React as best as I can, I figured working on a portfolio that can be ever-changing as I continue to grow as
a developer would be the best start!

As of now, I currently have the animated background set up using React Bits. Next changes are planned to be the navbar, cursor changes, and a header section!
